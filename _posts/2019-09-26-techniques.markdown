2. Techniques

Pentesting can be organized in different subjects and topics - I will follow the most common separation of 5 phases (1).

.1: Reconnaissance
.2: Scanning
.3: Gain Access
.4: Maintain Access
.5: Cover tracks

There are different ways to organize hacking - into more phases, for instance. However for the time being, having a general understanding of what techniques are required at these 5 phases is all I'm after.
I decided to use metasploitable 3 (2) as the target for executing the techniques explored here, I set it up as per the guide. (3)
